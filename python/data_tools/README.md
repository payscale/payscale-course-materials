# Data Tools

### Pandas
- A [tabular](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data manipulation library.
- Content in the `pandas/` directory
    - `examples.py` contains some things you can do in pandas
    - `exercise.py` contains some practice problems exercising techniques from `examples.py`
    - `solutions.py` contains solutions from `exercise.py`

### Numpy
- A numerical array library.
- [General Reference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/)
- [Reference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html) for generating statistical distributions
- Content in the `numpy/` directory
    - `examples.py` contains some things you can do numpy 
    - `exercise.py` contains some practice problems exercising techniques from `examples.py`
    - `solutions.py` contains solutions from `exercise.py`

### Matplotlib
- A plotting library.
- [Pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) reference.
- Content in the `matplotlib/` directory
    - `examples.py` shows some plots you can make with matplotlib
    - `exercise.py` contains a difficult matplotlib plot
    - `solutions.py` contains an example implementation for the exercise

### Scikit-Learn (and some Scipy)
- A machine learning library.
- We will learn about [clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering) algorithms.
  In particular, the [K-means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means) algorithm
  and the [Gaussian Mixed Model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#mixture) algorithm.
- Content in the `scikit_learn/` directory
    - `examples.py` contains some unsupervised clustering algorithm examples
- Another resource containing the same [examples](https://github.com/tojo13/network_monitoring/blob/master/low_traffic_filtering.ipynb).

### Data Cleaning Project
- An example exercise for data cleanup and normaliztion. This is a very common problem.
